# Gulla.Episerver.AutomaticImageDescription for CMS 12

This is the readme for the CMS 12 version, the version for CMS 11 is [over here](https://github.com/tomahg/Gulla.Episerver.AutomaticImageDescription/tree/cms11).

## Automatic metadata for images in Episerver/Optimizely
This addon will use Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services, Computer Vision API in combination with Translator Text API, to generate various metadata for images uploaded in Episerver/Optimizely CMS.

How you use the metadata on your site is entirely up to you. Some suggestions:
- Alt text for images, either directly or as a suggestion for editors to consider and adapt.
- Searchable metadata makes it easier to find the image you are looking for in Episerver edit mode.
- Use metadata to dynamically select what images to show in specific locations.

## Getting started
Visit the [Getting Started section](doc/GettingStarted.md) to learn how to install and configure the addon.

## Generating metadata when images are uploaded
Visit the [Generating Metadata section](doc/GeneratingMetadata.md) to learn all about how to generate metadata when images are uploaded.

## Generate metadata for your existing images
If your not starting from scratch you are likely to have a bunch of images previously uploaded to the CMS.  
Visit the [Scheduled job section](doc/ScheduledJob.md) to learn how you can populate metadata for your existing images.

## Use the attributes
The key to generating metadata, is adding the correct attribute.

## Localization
If your site have more than one language, you probably want metadata in more than one language too. This can be handled in a couple of different ways.
